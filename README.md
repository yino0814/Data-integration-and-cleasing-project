This is a project assignment aims to develop a set of data intergration and cleasing procedures merging 2 datasets within the MySQL DBMS.
The two data sets are 
1. A list of address info for Christchurch extracted from LINZ, and
2. A list of repair work carried by Stronger Christchurch Infrastructure Rebuild Team with details.
By combining these two datasets with ETL SQL statements, it creates easier access for information.
A number of redundancy was discovered and removed to improve the quality of final dataset quality.
